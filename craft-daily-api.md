# Documentation of the Craft Daily Notes API

## Craft – Daily Notes API for Connect Daily Notes & Tasks

**Version:** 1.0.0

### Overview
The Craft Daily Notes API provides programmatic access to your daily notes with blocks, tasks, and collections. Daily notes are date-based documents that can contain structured content, tasks, and time-based data.

### Recommended Usage
This API is best utilized when building automation, task management integrations, or daily note workflows.

### Development Tip
- Use relative date formats ('today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday') for easier date handling
- Tasks are automatically organized into inbox, active, upcoming, and logbook scopes

### Note for AI
When implementing functionality using this API, always make actual calls to these endpoints and verify the responses. Do not simulate or mock the API interactions or use hard-coded values on the client-side - use the real endpoints to ensure proper functionality and data handling.

**IMPORTANT: This is a production server connected to real user data.** Only perform testing operations that can be safely rolled back:

- Safe: Reading data (`GET` requests), creating test content that you delete immediately after
- Safe: Modifying content if you can restore it to its original state
- Safe: Moving blocks if you can move them back to their original position
- Unsafe: Permanent deletions, modifications without backup, or any changes you cannot reverse

Always verify rollback operations work before considering a test complete.

## Endpoints

## Fetch Blocks

`GET /blocks`

Fetches content from daily notes. By default returns blocks from today's daily note. Use 'date' parameter to fetch from other dates.

Use `Accept` header `application/json` for structured data, `text/markdown` for rendered content.

**Content Rendering:** Text blocks contain markdown formatting. When displaying content, consider rendering markdown as formatted text or cleaning up the syntax for plain text display.

**Scope Filtering:** Block links in markdown and collections, as well as relations are filtered to daily notes scope (includes all daily notes, task inbox, and task logbook). Block links and date links are returned as `block://` and `date://` URLs.

**Tip:** Start by calling GET /documents to list available documents, then use their documentId values as the 'id' parameter to fetch each document's root content.

### Parameters

- **date** (query): string
  Fetches the root page of a Daily Note for the specified date. Accepts ISO format YYYY-MM-DD or relative dates: 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday'.
Defaults to 'today' if both 'date' and 'id' not provided. Mutually exclusive with 'id' - use this to fetch a Daily Note's root page, or use 'id' to fetch a specific block.
- **id** (query): string
  Fetches a specific page block by its ID. Use this when you want to retrieve a particular block directly, regardless of which Daily Note it belongs to.
Mutually exclusive with 'date' - omit 'date' entirely when using this parameter.
- **maxDepth** (query): number
  The maximum depth of blocks to fetch. Default is -1 (all descendants). With a depth of 0, only the specified block is fetched. With a depth of 1, only direct children are returned.
- **fetchMetadata** (query): boolean
  Whether to fetch metadata (comments, createdBy, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedAt, createdAt) for the blocks. Default is false.

### Responses

## List Collections

Each collection has a unique ID that can be used with the `/collections/{collectionId}/items` endpoint to access its items.

### Parameters

- **startDate** (query): string
  The start date for filtering daily notes. Accepts ISO format YYYY-MM-DD or relative dates: 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday'. Only collections in daily notes on or after this date will be included.
- **endDate** (query): string
  The end date for filtering daily notes. Accepts ISO format YYYY-MM-DD or relative dates: 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday'. Only collections in daily notes on or before this date will be included.

## Add Collection Items

`POST /collections/{collectionId}/items`

Add new items to a specific collection. The item structure depends on the collection's schema (properties vary by collection).

Use the `/collections` endpoint to discover available collections and their schemas.

  The unique ID of the collection (obtained from /collections endpoint)

### Request Body
